# MemoryHelper
I've been studying English and C++. Then I think I can write a software to help me to memorize English sentences, and I can practice my C++ skill as well.

This software was developed with Visual Studio 2019 and Qt 5.15.1.

I only run this software on Windows 11.

## Entrance
The entrance file is LittleZha.cpp

## Logic
The logic of the software is to input what you want to memorize, then the software will compute the date to review the memories by using Forgetting Curve.
